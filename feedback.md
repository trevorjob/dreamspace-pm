1. Are we building for decorators, designers or both? I think we are building for both so let’s reword decorators to designers (more technical and also a more umbrella term)
2. ⁠For the Project management MVP we want to achieved easy intiation, documentation, progress tracking and project closure/execution. Hence, for an mvp, do we need to build a platform that supports moodboard design, or one that documents moodboards? So for me 1, 2, 4 and 5 are more ideal for the MVP.
3. ⁠for the vendors and products it’s quite unclear why we have a save vendors you’ve worked with as well as save product provision when we don’t have a vendor marker place (except we are assuming we do). If we are assuming we do then we should start with including a vendor facing interface that admits vendors and artisans.
4. ⁠finally in my opinion I think there should be a logistics leg. But this is up for debate. 

Initial reaction.
@NANDOM @jerry_dalz feel free to respond. I actually think this was the whole point right Job lol.

Thanks

[00:33, 21/11/2025] jerry_dalz: Awesome! @NANDOM 

Kindly permit me to jump on this much later in the day, I need to go through and digest it well enough.
[00:37, 21/11/2025] jerry_dalz: I will drop my opinions on these too.
[21:25, 21/11/2025] jerry_dalz: Good evening team.
[21:25, 21/11/2025] jerry_dalz: So the term 'Interior designers' sounds more professional than 'interior decorators' career-wise, so I'll agree with @Ikechukwu Dreamspace David on that.
[21:31, 21/11/2025] jerry_dalz: I also don't think we might need moodboard design and documentation as part of the MVP for now, it can be an add-on, but we should be able to launch without it.
[21:36, 21/11/2025] jerry_dalz: Instead, we might need the market place, this would also help onboard new users faster. Especially the artisans. 

And the pool of artisans, will now attract the professional users that are our main target audience. 

Note that the project manager user interface will most likely be used by clients (interior designers and recruiters), the artisans might not see the need for project management unless they're handling a large-scale project. 

But the marketplace is open to everyone, those offering services and those patronizing them. 

That is an aspect of revenue generation, and can even exist as somewhat an independent ecosystem on its own.
[21:40, 21/11/2025] jerry_dalz: The logistics you mentioned here is also a good idea, but we will not need that for the MVP. 

We can also roll-out that feature later on. Let's have it as part of our expansion plan.
[21:49, 21/11/2025] Ikechukwu Dreamspace David: Thanks Jerry for your input
[21:49, 21/11/2025] Ikechukwu Dreamspace David: Really appreciate
